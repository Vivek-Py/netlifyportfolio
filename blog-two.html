            <p>Git makes it easy to contribute to open source projects
                Nearly every open-source project uses GitHub to manage their projects. Using GitHub is free if your project is open source, and it includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more in-depth documentation and get feedback about your project.
                
                If you want to contribute, you just fork (get a copy of) a project, make your changes, and then send the project a pull request using GitHub's web interface. This pull request is your way of telling the project you're ready for them to review your changes.
                
                Documentation
                By using GitHub, you make it easier to get excellent documentation. Their help section and guides have articles for nearly any topic related to Git that you can think of.
                
                Integration options
                GitHub can integrate with common platforms such as Amazon and Google Cloud, with services such as Code Climate to track your feedback, and can highlight syntax in over 200 different programming languages.
                
                Track changes in your code across versions
                When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track of revisions — who changed what, when, and where those files are stored.
                
                GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.
                
                Much like using Microsoft Word or Google Drive, you can have a version history of your code so that previous versions are not lost with every iteration. It’s easy to come back to the previous version and contribute your work.
                
                Showcase your work
                Are you a developer who wishes to attract recruiters? GitHub is the best tool you can rely on for this.
                
                Today, when searching for new recruits for their projects, most companies look at GitHub profiles. If your profile is available, you will have a higher chance of being recruited even if you are not from a great university or college.</p>
